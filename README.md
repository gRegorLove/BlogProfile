# ProcessWire Blog Profile

## About the Blog Profile

This is a basic blog profile designed to get you started quickly. The profile 
can be used as-is or modified to suit your needs. This blog profile was made 
by Ryan Cramer for use with ProcessWire open source CMS/CMF version 2.2+. The 
front-end uses the Skeleton CSS framework, making it responsive and mobile friendly. 
The color scheme used on this profile is based on Nikola Vidoni's Futura admin 
theme for ProcessWire. 

For an example of this blog profile in action, see http://processwire.com/blogtest/

That is all there is to do. Install ProcessWire as per the instructions
