# ProcessWire Blog Profile

## About the Blog Profile

This is a basic blog profile designed to get you started quickly. The profile 
can be used as-is or modified to suit your needs. This blog profile was made 
by Ryan Cramer for use with ProcessWire open source CMS/CMF version 2.5+. The 
front-end uses the Skeleton CSS framework, making it responsive and mobile friendly. 
The color scheme used on this profile is based on Nikola Vidoni's Futura admin 
theme for ProcessWire. 

For an example of this blog profile in action, see http://processwire.com/blogtest/

This profile requires ProcessWire 2.5 or newer. 

## How to Install

Grab a copy of the [latest ProcessWire](http://processwire.com/download/). 
Copy or upload the /site-blog/ directory and everything in it to the root of 
your ProcessWire files. This is the same directory that ProcessWire's index.php
and /site-default/ directories live. So you'll have a /site-blog/ alongside
ProcessWire's /site-default/ and any other profiles it comes with. 

Load the URL in your browser to initiate the installer. Select the "Blog Profile"
from the dropdown when prompted to do so. The installer will take care of the rest.
